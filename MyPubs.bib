ABSTRACT = {This manuscript presents the Microwave Temperature and Humidity Profiler (MTHP), a dual-band spectroradiometer designed for measuring multi-incidence angle temperature and humidity atmospheric profiles from an aircraft platform. The MTHP bands are at 60 GHz for measuring the oxygen complex lines, therefore at this band, MTHP has a hyperspectral radiometer able to provide 2048 channels over an 8 GHz bandwidth, and 183 GHz for measuring water vapor, which only uses four channels since this absorption band’s spectral richness is simpler. The MTHP builds upon the Microwave Temperature Profiler (MTP) with the inclusion of the hyperspectral radiometer. The instrument’s design, components, and calibration methods are discussed in detail, with a focus on the three-point calibration scheme involving internal calibration loads and static air temperature readings. Preliminary results from the Technological Innovation into Iodine and GV aircraft Environmental Research (TI3GER) campaign are presented, showcasing the instrument’s performance during flights across diverse geographical regions. The manuscript presents successful antenna temperature measurements at 60 GHz and 183 GHz. The hyperspectral measurements are compared with a simulated antenna temperature using the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS) showing an agreement better than R2 > 0.88 for three of the flights analyzed. Additionally, the manuscript draws attention to potential Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) effects observed during a specific flight, underscoring the instrument’s sensitivity to external interference. This is the first-ever airborne demonstration of a broadband and hyperspectral multi-incidence angle 60 GHz measurement. Future work on the MTHP could result in an improved spatial resolution of the atmospheric temperature vertical profile and, hence, help in estimating the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) with better accuracy. The MTHP and its hyperspectral multi-incidence angle at 60 GHz have the potential to be a valuable tool for investigating the PBL’s role in atmospheric dynamics, offering insights into its impact on Earth’s energy, water, and carbon cycles.},

	abstract = {An endfire synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for use on a cylindrical ice-penetrating cryobot is presented. The SAR facilitates obstacle detection and mapping inside ice for subsurface exploration using such a cryobot vehicle. The SAR is comprised of four azimuthally arranged directional log periodic antenna elements flush-mounted onto the cryobot's surface. Aperture synthesis is facilitated by the downward trajectory of the cryobot as it slowly melts through ice. The radar front end and back end are designed using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components and a customized field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based digital design for signal generation, reception, and processing. Theoretical analysis of the SAR geometry is presented for the case of a point target in which the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach is used for position estimator development. The novelty of this system lies in the use of pairs of antennas, with fixed baselines between them, to implement multiple coherent monostatic SARs to estimate target position in three dimensions. Specifically, range estimation is implemented by conventional chirp processing, polar (or elevation) angle estimation is achieved by SAR processing, and azimuth angle estimation is facilitated using pairs of four azimuthally arranged antennas that can be analyzed as multiple fixed baseline interferometric radars. Radar signal coherency tests and experimental validation of point target estimation and spatial resolution performed in a laboratory environment using the endfire SAR are presented in this study.},

abstract = {The Jet Propulsion Laboratory has developed a 170 GHz airborne radar for cloud and humidity remote sensing. Called VIPR (Vapor Inside-cloud Profiling Radar), the system uses differential absorption at closely spaced frequencies near the 183 GHz water vapor resonance to obtain range-profiling measurements of absolute humidity inside clouds, and partial-water- column measurements in clear skies. VIPR transmits around 300 mW over 167-174.8 GHz, has a system noise figure of 8 dB, and uses a 60-cm diameter aperture. The radar has been deployed both on the ground pointing toward zenith, and from an aircraft with nadir pointing. Based on architectures originally developed for submillimeter-wave security imaging, VIPR uses ultra-high-isolation transmit/receive duplexing with a single primary antenna. This approach achieves thermal noise limited sensitivity even while using frequency-modulated continuous-wave ranging methods, and even when the radar is mounted in an aircraft with its beam emerging from an open-air viewport. Here we present a validation measurement of VIPR's ability to sense humidity in clear skies using ground reflection magnitudes at different altitudes and frequencies. These results have also motivated a new investigation of using a higher-frequency 557 GHz differential absorption radar for water vapor sensing in the low pressure, cold, and dry conditions on Mars. We have developed a 552-558 GHz RF source with several mW of output power that could be used for making local humidity measurements on Mars out to several kilometer ranges.},
